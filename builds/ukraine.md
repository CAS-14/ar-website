### History
This build was created by [Tedders](/members/tedders) on January 30, 2022. It is still a work in progress. It is located on a hill near spawn in the [Creative Season 5](/worlds/arc5) world. Originally, this build was meant as a joke, and there were plans to build a communist bunker under it as a reference to the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine. Howver, these plans were discontinued because the war became more serious. Not long after the war started in Ukraine, a Ukrainian flag was built outside this build, to show support.
