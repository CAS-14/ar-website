### History
The garden's basic layout was created by [SodaCity](/members/sodacity) in February 2022. The garden is located south of the [city](arc45city) in the flat area of [Season 5](/worlds/arc5). It originally consisted of an azalea leaf pattern outlining a square path and a fountain in the center. On February 10, 2022, [quvio](/members/quvio) began adding to the garden, as per SodaCity's request. Quvio's terraforming skills brought the garden to life, and he added tall grass, flowers, ponds, and other details.

### Documentation
This pretty garden is a peaceful place and is great for enjoying nature, pondering life, or eating borgars.

### Trivia
- [dynamite14](/members/dynamite14) was asked to center the fountain using the clone command, because the paths were not equidistant from it.
- The train line was extended to the garden, but currently does not have a station (yet)
- Salmon stack, cow stack
