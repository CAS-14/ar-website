### History
This world was the original realm world. It was uploaded in spring of 2017. Unfortunately it got corrupted randomly in 2018 and it could not be restored or joined. About a year later, the world was deleted from the realm.  

The world consisted of some floating islands built over the overworld. The original world was quite old. The intention of this world was for people to explore and play on the islands, and build below, or add more islands.
