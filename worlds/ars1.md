### History
This was the first Survival world on the Realm. It was incredibly fun. Originally, this world was just going to be [Will19091990](/members/willh), [dynamite14](/members/dynamite14), and some of Will's friends. Dynamite14 and Will went to the same summer camp, along with some of Will's friends, and they all decided to start a new survival world. There was one survival world before it, but it was a private world between dynamite14 and Will, known now as [Survival Season W](arsw). This was originally just going to be that, but then dynamite14 had the idea of inviting the other members of the Realm, and the world became very popular.
