### History
This world was started after the [Dead Period](/history/dead-period). Many members became active again in late January 2022. [Dynamite14](/members/dynamite14) stated that the [previous world](arc4) brought back bad memories for him, and wanted to start over. [ChefArmor](/members/chefarmor) wanted to continue work on the [city from Season 4](/builds/arc45city), so dynamite14 used structure blocks to copy it piece by piece. Part of the new overworld was flattened for easier building and the city was placed there. New builds began to spring up around it.
