**Note:** Rules #1-12 are the same for Creative and Survival.

### Creative Rules

1. Treat everyone with respect, don't be an ass, and have fun!
2. Griefing is not permitted. Some pranking is allowed as long as effort is put in and it doesn't affect the build overall.
3. Leave a fair amount of space between builds. The bigger the build is, the more space you should leave. Just use your judgement.
4. Keep very tall builds extra far from other builds.
5. Do not build in the sky over popular areas, without clearance from an Admin.
6. Killing without permission is typically not permitted unless you know they would be okay with it or it is necessary to solve a problem.
7. Do not do anything that would lag out the Realm. Not everyone has a good PC. Do not use more than 5000 TNT at a time, do not summon tons of entities, and don't do anything redstone intensive.
8. Make sure things look good overall. For example, don't build pink and lime pixel art in the middle of a city.
9. Stealing is not permitted, even in Creative, because someone could have put effort into storing items in something or making a custom item.
10. Do not grief nearby generated structures (like villages or temples), unless you plan to contribute something with effort of your own.
11. Do not change others builds without their permission.
​12. Conflicts will be settled by the Admins. If there is a conflict, contact them.
13. Do not destroy/ruin the landscape, even if an area is empty. This counts as a low-effort build.
14. Builds should exhibit at least a little effort. If you spam wood planks everywhere in a high-priority area, you can expect them to be removed.
15. Having command permissions (OP) is a privilege, not a right. Do not abuse them such as killing all entities, clearing players, excessively killing players, generating lag, teleporting others without permission, etc.

### Survival Rules

1. Treat everyone with respect, don't be an ass, and have fun!
2. Griefing is not permitted. Some pranking is allowed as long as effort is put in and it doesn't affect the build overall.
3. Leave a fair amount of space between builds. The bigger the build is, the more space you should leave. Just use your judgement.

11. Do not change others builds without their permission.
​12. Conflicts will be settled by the Admins. If there is a conflict, contact them.
13. Do not use operator commands in Survival. They are typically taken away upon world switch, but do not use them if dynamite14 forgot to deop people.
14. You must follow the rules of a shop. Shops typically have a set price or a rule to follow before taking items. Stealing from a shop is a violation of MC Common Rule 9.
15. Do not leave trees floating, unless you are really far away where no one would care. Also, replant trees in scenic forests.
16. If a creeper explodes near you and makes a hole, consider leaving a sign for the owner of that area, or try to patch it up yourself. Try not to let this happen; eg: don't engage in a fight with a creeper in an area with builds.
17. Keep things decent looking.
18. Don't exploit KeepInventory (when applicable) in order to regenerate health or hunger. It can be used as a way to get back to spawn, but use this sparingly only when needed.
19. Do not build in claimed areas.
20. Respect Do Not Enter signs.
21. The use of cheat clients, FullBright, or XRay is prohibited. This includes XRay texture packs!
22. Do not exploit OptiFine dynamic lighting or a similar feature. Light up your mines!
