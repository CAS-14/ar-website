## Groups on the Realm

This page tells the story of several groups on the Realm over time.

### The Story
The first groups were created in [Survival Season 1](/worlds/ars1). Originally, [dynamite14](/members/dynamite14) created a team called the [Police](/builds/police), who were committed to enforcing the rules on the survival world. This was before the time of the Discord server or the official Realm rules, but rules were needed in this world due to there being some disorder. [Admiral Zoster](/members/zoster) was chosen to be the second "police officer". The police were never intended to become a group.

[ChefArmor](/members/chefarmor) was late to join the first Survival world, but when he did, he and [Pierce](/members/pierce) formed a group known as the Phantom Thieves. This was inspired by Persona 5, a game that both of them enjoyed. The Phantom Thieves intended to revolt (just slightly) against the Police's enforced rules. Not wanting to make rule evasion into a game, dynamite14 formed a group known as the DirtHippies as something for the Phantom Thieves to fight against. Admiral Zoster formed a new group known as the Brotherhood of Steel, in order to stop the DirtHippies and Phantom Thieves from creating wars.

Over time, Zoster's group evolved into a high-tech security company known as S.T.A.R.S., and he created an underground bunker in the Survival world. Wanting competition with the highly futuristic company, dynamite14 transformed DirtHippies into G.O.S.O., which stood for "Government/Goons Organization of Secret/Soil Operations" and also "Get Out and Stay Out". G.O.S.O. soon has a bunker of their own, although it was never finished besides the first basic hallway.

Eventually, [Creative Season 2](/worlds/arc2) had a new wave of activity in autumn 2019, and the groups moved into this world. There were G.O.S.O. and S.T.A.R.S. bunkers in Bunker Basin, a giant hole in the ground. Later, G.O.S.O. changed its name to Byrd Technologies and S.T.A.R.S. changed its name to Goodcorp. The groups became the main rivals, and had several fictional wars across the Creative worlds. Eventually, ChefArmor joined Byrd Technologies.

The groups persisted this way but slowly became less active. Goodcorp did not have a bunker in [Creative Season 4](/worlds/arc4), although it did have a spaceport and a train line. Byrd Technologies changed its name once again in [Creative Season 3](/worlds/arc3) to Hamachi Industries. The Hamachi Industries headquarter in Season 4 were the largest yet, although a Hamachi Industries base is yet to be created in [Season 5](/worlds/arc5).
