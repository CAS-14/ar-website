## Dead Period

The dead period was a period of inactivity on the Realm that occurred from early November 2021 to late January 2022. In early November 2021, there was some drama in the close-knitted Chez Cult. As a result of this, the Realm became quite inactive. This also resulted in the third ban of [Swizzles](/members/alex) When tension died down, the friendgroup mostly got back together, and the realm became active again. [Creative Season 5](/worlds/arc5) was started because [Season 4](/worlds/arc4) brought back bad memories for [dynamite14](/members/dynamite14). Some people did not want to start a new world, and [ChefArmor](/members/chefarmor) requested that the [city project from Season 4](/builds/arc45city) be copied into the new world, which it was. See [/worlds/arc5] for more information on Season 5.
