### About

Welcome to Awesome Realm's website. This is just a small unprofessional website so I can write the lore and history here. Pick a page or category to go to above. Read below for info.

Awesome Realm is a Minecraft server, not a realm. It used to be a Realm until April of 2022, when I switched it over to a Shockbyte hosted server. It is always on the latest version of Minecraft. It has a whitelist. This website serves as a wiki for the history and lore of the server, as well as holding the [rules](rules).

Server Address: `mc.act25.com` (or `51.91.17.191:25567` if the domain doesn't work)

More stuff coming soon, as always.
